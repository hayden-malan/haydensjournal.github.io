        Sitting at home on my bed, room is clean, self care is mostly done for today.
         Feeling kind of anxious to be honest. 
         A lot of things are happening all at once and I'm not sure if I can keep track of everything.

          I'm really liking my music playlist though! I have a mix I'm listening to, I might link it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZLOX3jDfFI&list=RDFZLOX3jDfFI" target="_blank">here</a>.
          A little while ago I was playing guitar again for the first time in a while, I'm learning alternate strums for "Suspicious Minds". Steel strings are rough on fingers.

        <p class="text-center">
            I follow an artist who does some strange and wonderful things, often draws.
             I'll link a video of his 
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yDuSecwBas" target="_blank">here</a> 
             (it's called "drawing your feelings, a calm guide")

    <h5>What else:</h5>
        <p class="text-center">
            I've been struggling to direct my energy and motivate myself today. It has been hard to remind myself to cut me some slack,
            I've been going through a lot this year! I tend to forget that. In terms of what I'm going to try do the rest of the week to stay
            more focused: I'm going to make a moodboard that reflects what I want to happen these next few months, write up some goals on a board on 
            my wall, give myself some rewards at tangible milestones. I really need to get onto this jobhunt thing properly!
            Here's to holding myself accountable.
