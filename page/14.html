        <h5>In control</h5>
        <p>
            More and more people have been telling me recently, that I am in control. In control of my emotions. Of my situation.
            Of my life. Very empowering news.
        </p>
        <p>
             I have been striving to understand it more, as for me it is a huge stress from my previous understandings. In the English language,
             when someone is sad, usually I would ask "Why are you sad?" or "What made you sad?". I would certainly not ask
             "Why are you choosing to be sad?".
        </p>
        <p>
            But now I have been encouraged to ask myself "Why are you choosing to be sad?". I've been advised to take control.
            To choose to be happy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently trying my best to implement this as much as I can. That is all for the day.
