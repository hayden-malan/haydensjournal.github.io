        <h5>Today I showed up.</h5>
        <p>
        Had some important appointments to attend to, and I did, and it was hard, but I did it. Am super tired now,
        but I am determined to keep ticking along with some projects and start back up with Transpire to get it done 
        before the end of April.
        </p>
        <p>
             The move is happening in about 10 days and I am rather nervous but hopefully after that I'll be able to dedicate
             more time to the code.
