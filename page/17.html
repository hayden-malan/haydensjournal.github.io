        <h5>(with much needed help from my father)</h5>
        <p>
           Today I successfully can dualboot Ubuntu and Windows 10 on my laptop, and have internet connectivity when using Windows.
        </p>
        <p>
           This is a big deal considering yesterday I only had Ubuntu, no Windows backup partition, and no idea what my product key or windows license key was.
        </p>
        <p>
            This has been a fabulous and challenging learning experience, but it is safe to say I'll think twice before erasing my default operating system on a laptop again.
        </p>
        <p>
         I still think it is really really really cool how an ISO image on a CD can be used to boot an operating system. 
        </p>
        <p>In other news, I think my health is getting a little bit better, and I am looking forward to various appointments I have this week to see if I can get more help. 1 week till I move! Super excited.</p>
