        <h4><b>The week so far:</b></h4>
      <p class="text-center">
        This week has been utterly wild, and by this week I mostly mean last week. 
        To summarise, I signed a lease to a flat, which means for the first time ever 
        I'm going to be moving out! It's happening in a few weeks, I am excited.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center">
          In the mean time I've been applying for various junior dev jobs, and hanging out
          with some of my many beloved friends. It has been so refreshing and wonderfully 
          heart warming to be the recipient of so much kindness and generosity over the last 
          few weeks. I can't wait to see what happens next!

            <h4><b>What's up right now:</b></h4>
        <p class="text-center">
            Today I'm joining my friend Daniel,who has come up from the South Island for the 
            day to attend a job interview at a company quite close to me. I am so excited for him,
            as his only contact in Wellington I really hope that he can get a job here so that he can 
            experience more of the fabulous life.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            So as he is currently attending an interview, I'm in the parking lot tapping away on my laptop.
            I haven't ever been coding in a car before so this is new! People probably think I'm a little strange. 
            That's ok. As long as they don't chase me out of here before he is done with his interview.
