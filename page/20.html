        <h5>How does one do being?</h5>
        <p>
       Someone mentioned to me today how meditation, is essentially, being. Practicing just being. Something I haven't prioritised in a while, which is ironic considering I'm a human being.
        </p>
        <p>
       Lately I've felt more like a human doing. I think our society greatly prioritises doing. Material gains and rewards are important to us, money, scores, the measurable things that we can assess ourselves on.
       They're becoming more and more crucial to our survival. In my case I think I may have forgotten why I do all these things. Why would I spend my whole life "doing" well, if I cannot "be" well?
        </p>
        <p>
            I aspire to one day be able to answer the question "How are you?" with the answer "I am well" rather than "I'm doing well".
