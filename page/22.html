        <h5>"You can't feel dumb for not knowing how to launch a rocket."</h5>
        <p>
      I got some helpful perspective from a friend today about how harshly I criticise myself for not being able to solve problems that aren't problems I've ever learnt to solve.
        </p>
        <p>
      Perhaps I have been an ambitious person throughout my life and so far it has worked well, but sometimes I can be a little bit too ambitious.
        </p>
        <p>
       I guess it is important to acknowledge my own strengths and abilities, and to not berate myself for not knowing how to solve everything under thr sun.
        </p>
        <p>
       This could be how to be kinder to myself. I am unsure, I am still figuring out what the line is between accepting my lack of knowledge, and pushing myself to know more.
