        <h5>(for your comic relief needs)</h5>
        <p>
           Today I've been wrestling a variety of software and the software has been winning.
        </p>
        <p>
             Lesson 1: Do not fully remove windows from an hp computer, install linux, then try to resize the partitions in the C drive to make room for windows again, and expect it to be easy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lesson 2: Do not delete the keyboard on an android smartphone, and expect to be able to get back into said phone once it is locked using the power of speech-to-text alone. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Lesson 3: When purchasing rewritable disks to use as bootable disks , do not purchase 700MB cd's. That's not enough for a decent operating system. Come on.
        </p>
        <p>And finally, Lesson 4: Do not attempt to wrangle your technology when your wellbeing is not in a position of utmost balance. Also wait until the end of Mercury Retrograde, which, in this case, is ending on the 16th of April 2018. The more you know.</p>
