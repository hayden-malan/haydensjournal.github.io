                <h5>A change in perspective helps.</h5>
                <p> Often I can get trapped in a sense of disconnectedness. </p>
                <p> It's not something that gets in the way of things I want to do. Provided I have things I want to do. </p>
                <p> It was really great going outside today to talk to my friends. Even the small things like that can help.
                    No big fuss had to be made, all I needed was a reason to get some fresh air. </p>
                <p> I am grateful for my friends. They make my world a happier place. </p>
