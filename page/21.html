        <h5>Especially this time.</h5>
        <p>
       I finally moved my bed today. It's been in the same place for the last 2 years.
        </p>
        <p>
       But this is more than a move from 2 years of living one place.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is <b>the</b> move. I am moving out, and venturing into the world of renting. For the first time in my whole life.
        Exciting stuff. Challenging stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            It only really sunk in once my bed had been moved today. It hit harder than I thought it would.
