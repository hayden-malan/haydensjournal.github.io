        <h5>Hard to focus on one thing.</h5>
        <p>
          I feel like an area of growth I'd like to work on this week is definitely how to prioritise and make better actionable lists of all the tasks that seem to be flying around my head at any moment in time.
          Today I got a lot of things done, and I am proud of that, but I also worry that there are things I missed, crucial things I just didn't get time for.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think it can be hard to stay focused, especially in the age of the 1 minute attention span, where we have distractions for our distractions, and even simple tasks are all intermixed with other tasks.
            I hope that soon I can find (or make) the space and time to be mindful. To do one thing and give it my full focus.
